# Gladiator

A end year project my partner Tristan and I did. He did the all the art work, I did all the code save a few lines.
Make sure you have XNA installed on the system, otherwise the project __will not load correctly__. 

(If using a more modern visual studio, download XNA refresh [here](https://mxa.codeplex.com/releases). It's just like normal XNA.)
